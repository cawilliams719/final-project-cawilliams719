## Final Project: Script 2
### Your Chosen Assignment
For this script, you will complete the assignment that you have proposed, which involves modifying a previous exercise or attempting something new. Remember to create a .py file and to include comments and documentation in your script to tell me what itâ€™s doing!

*Note:* You are not required to do the "script 1" portion of the project. This didn't get sent out on time (my mistake) and it's too late now. 

## Final Project: Documentation
### Changing this README
Your write-up will be here, on this README page. You will need to edit this page with your new text: you do **not** need to keep these instructions on your README!
